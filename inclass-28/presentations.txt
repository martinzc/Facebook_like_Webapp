I learned most from the presentation on WebGL. It talks about web graphics library and how it helps to render 2D/3D graphics
in the browser. Also, I learned that this framework can be integrated in canvas without any plugins, which makes it very
easy to integrate. However, the downside of this framework is that it consumes a lot of GPU resource.

The presentation on WebGL interest me a lot. The reason is that I am always interested in seeing how web graphics is rendered
and the presenter really did a good job covering all the materials.
