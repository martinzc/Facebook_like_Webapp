	<p>I am writing in search for a software engineering internship position in summer 2017.</p>
	<p>Being a senior at Rice University, I believe I am well prepared for positions that require strong algorithmic thinking and coding structure. Relevant courses I’ve taken include parallel programming, computer system, database development, reasoning about algorithms, etc. </p>
	<p>My most recent industry experience is being a software developer intern at Labatt Food Service in San Antonio during the summer of 2016. I learned web app development and pushed into production a web tool that generated monthly meat inventory report. This application saved the manager of cooking plant from spending a month of time each year creating reports manually. It also visualized numbers into graphs with various options so that it was easier for the manager to communicate inventory with executives. I also researched for a better model and improved yearly meat sale forecast by reducing percentage error by 30.6%.</p>
	<p>In addition, I am particularly enthusiastic about mobile app development. I participated in the design and prototype phase of two mobile applications during the summer of 2014 and 2015 and both applications are now published in App stores. As a research assistant at Rice, I also developed an iOS app that used advanced location services to track user’s workout data.</p>
	<p>Thank you very much for considering me. I hope my former experience and my skill sets will be a match for your opening position.</p>
